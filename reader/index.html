  <h1> Unbound: The politics of scanning </h1>

  <br><br><br>


  <p>There's a great scene in the first episode of House of Cards where the ambitious young journalist Zoe Barnes is sitting on the floor of her rented apartment's living room scanning the half-shredded documents of an education bill that was forwarded to her by her source/lover Frank Underwood, the Majority Whip. She's drinking wine, taking notes on her laptop, and scanning on her small all-in-one desktop printer/scanner. The next day she shows up at the office of the newspaper where she works with a 3000-word text and the 300-page document scanned, prompting her editors that "We should get this online right away."</p>

  <p>Barnes's character is young and ambitious. Later in the season she moves on to work for a site called "Slugline," an early-Politico-like newswire, where "journalists post news directly from their phones." Her obsession with technology is used as a narrative device in the series to set her apart from her older, more conservative editors at the newspaper. And her ambition to upload information to the newspaper's site as soon as possible, to give the public the raw data before it can be filtered or analyzed, stands for her idealism. (CSS)</p>

  <br>


  <p>The romanticized image of the scanner is based on the assumption that by scanning and uploading we make information available, and that that is somehow an invariably democratic act. Scanning has become synonymous with transparency and access. But does the document dump generate meaningful analysis, or make it seem insignificant? Does the internet enable widespread distribution, or does it more commonly facilitate centralized access? And does the scanner make things transparent, or does it transform them? The contemporary political imaginary links the scanner with democracy, and so we should explore further the political possibilities, values, and limitations associated with the process of scanning documents to be uploaded to the internet.</p>

  <h2>Collect and disperse</h2>

  <br>
  <br>


<p>When Viktor Yanukovych—who was the President of Ukraine from 2010 and until he was ousted following violent mass demonstrations all over the country—fled to Russia in February 2014, hundreds of folders were spotted in the reservoir in the ex-President's estate. A group of journalists and activists arrived at the site and thus began the project to save and make available the papers documenting Yanukovych's corrupt, violent regime. They did not leave the mansion for days, drying and scanning the documents—a scenario that raises the bar considerably on Zoe Barnes. In an interview with Mashable, one of the members of the team (the technologist who built the website onto which they uploaded content), explained that their "first priority was to get the information out. The situation has turned out very well so far, but at the start we didn't have any idea whether everybody would be removed. So we wanted to get documents secured, and get them out in public to show that this is about transparency and accountability."

<h1> Library of the Printed Web </h1>
<br><br> <br>
<p>Library of the Printed Web is a collection of works by artists who use screen capture, image grab, site scrape and search query to create printed matter from content found on the web. LotPW includes self-published artists’ books, photo books, texts and other print works gathered around the casual concept of “search, compile and publish.”</p>

<br>
<p>Rather than draw boundaries or define a new aesthetic, this collection of printed artifacts is presented as a reference tool for studying shifting relationships between the web (as culture), the artist (as archivist) and print publishing (as a new/old self-serve schema for expressing the archive).</p>

<p> <i> The collection exists as a physical archive of artists’ books housed in a special wooden display case on wheels in New York City. LotPW includes at least one copy of each item in the inventory, except where noted. A travel edition of the collection is available.</i> </p>
<br>
<p> <i> An archive of archives <br>
via a network of networks.</i> </p>

<br>

<p>Many of the books in this collection are something like printout matter, referring to the aesthetic defaults of digital publishing while physically existing in an earlier format of mass media archive — the ‘hard copy’, where their internals are transitioned but largely preserved.</p>
<br>
<p> Guthrie Lonergan’s 93.1 JACK FM is a five-volume printout of a year’s playlist from the LA radio station of the same name. JACK FM has no DJs and is entirely opaque about how the music it plays is chosen. So what does a tabular, quantitative history of those choices tell us on their own? Is there anything substantive in these thousands of pages?
</p>

<br>

<p>Elsewhere, the books use the offlining process to engage with the social conditions of internet behaviour, as in Stephanie Syjuco’s books — or ‘non-specific product units’ — which seem to evangelically revolve around the ‘freeness’ of text:</p>

<p>— and David Horvitz’s Public Access, detailing a highly codified and tactical Wikipedian argument around whether photos of the artist taken at a series of beaches along the Western Coast of the USA constitute valid and public ‘digital resources’ of the beaches in question.</p>

<br>
<p>Often, the poetics of both the material and the sourcing techniques are brought out in their transition — or traversal — to print, while specific narratives are suppressed. The database and the network might have a centre, but not a start or an end. It’ll tell you a different story depending on the question that it’s asked.</p>
