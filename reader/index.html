    <h1>Unbound: The politics of scanning.</h1>
  </div>







  <br><br><br>


  <p>There's a great scene in the first episode of House of Cards where the ambitious young journalist Zoe Barnes is sitting on the floor of her rented apartment's living room scanning the half-shredded documents of an education bill that was forwarded to her by her source/lover Frank Underwood, the Majority Whip. She's drinking wine, taking notes on her laptop, and scanning on her small all-in-one desktop printer/scanner. The next day she shows up at the office of the newspaper where she works with a 3000-word text and the 300-page document scanned, prompting her editors that "We should get this online right away."</p>

  <p>Barnes's character is young and ambitious. Later in the season she moves on to work for a site called "Slugline," an early-Politico-like newswire, where "journalists post news directly from their phones." Her obsession with technology is used as a narrative device in the series to set her apart from her older, more conservative editors at the newspaper. And her ambition to upload information to the newspaper's site as soon as possible, to give the public the raw data before it can be filtered or analyzed, stands for her idealism. (CSS)</p>

  <br>


  <p>The <a class="popup" href="#">romanticized <span><img src="images/scanner.png" height="350px" width="450px"></span></a> image of the scanner is based on the assumption that by scanning and uploading we make information available, and that that is somehow an invariably democratic act. Scanning has become synonymous with transparency and access.


    But does the document dump generate meaningful analysis, or make it seem insignificant? Does the internet enable widespread distribution, or does it more commonly facilitate centralized access? And does the scanner make things transparent, or does it transform them? The contemporary political imaginary links the scanner with <a class="popup" href="#">democracy <span><img src="images/democracy.jpg" height="350px" width="450px"></span></a> , and so we should explore further the political possibilities, values, and limitations associated with the process of scanning documents to be uploaded to the internet.</p>

  <br>


  <h2>Collect and disperse</h2>

  <br>
  <br>


<p>When <a class="popup" href="#">Viktor Yanukovych <span><img src="images/viktor.png" height="310px" width="450px"></span></a>—who was the President of Ukraine from 2010 and until he was ousted following violent mass demonstrations all over the country—fled to Russia in February 2014, hundreds of folders were spotted in the <a class="popup" href="#">reservoir <span><img src="images/documents.png" height="190px" width="250px"></span></a> in the ex-President's estate. A group of journalists and activists arrived at the site and thus began the project to save and make available the papers documenting Yanukovych's corrupt, violent regime. They did not leave the mansion for days, drying and scanning the documents—a scenario that raises the bar considerably on Zoe Barnes. In an interview with Mashable, one of the members of the team (the technologist who built the website onto which they uploaded content), explained that their "first priority was to get the information out. The situation has turned out very well so far, but at the start we didn't have any idea whether everybody would be removed. So we wanted to get documents secured, and get them out in public to show that this is about transparency and accountability."

 <h1>Library of the Printed Web</h1>
</div>

<br><br>
<p>Library of the Printed Web is a collection of works by artists who use screen capture, image grab, site scrape and search query to create printed matter from content found on the web. LotPW includes self-published artists’ books, photo books, texts and other print works gathered around the casual concept of “search, compile and publish.”</p>

<br>
<p>Rather than draw boundaries or define a new aesthetic, this collection of printed artifacts is presented as a reference tool for studying shifting relationships between the web (as culture), the artist (as archivist) and print publishing (as a new/old self-serve schema for expressing the archive).</p>

<p> <i> The collection exists as a physical archive of artists’ books housed in a special <a class="popup" href="#">wooden display case <span><img src="images/libraryonwheels.png" height="310px" width="450px"></span></a> on wheels in New York City. LotPW includes at least one copy of each item in the inventory, except where noted. A travel edition of the collection is available.</i> </p>
<br>
<p> <i> An archive of archives <br>
via a network of networks.</i> </p>

<br>

<p>Many of the books in this collection are something like printout matter, referring to the aesthetic defaults of digital publishing while physically existing in an earlier format of mass media archive — the ‘hard copy’, where their internals are transitioned but largely preserved.</p>
<br>
<p> Guthrie Lonergan’s 93.1 JACK FM is a five-volume printout of a year’s playlist from the LA radio station of the same name. <a class="popup" href="#">JACK FM <span><img src="images/jackfm.png" height="100px" width="300px"></span></a> has no DJs and is entirely opaque about how the music it plays is chosen. So what does a tabular, quantitative history of those choices tell us on their own? Is there anything substantive in these thousands of pages?
</p>

<br>

<p>Elsewhere, the books use the offlining process to engage with the social conditions of internet behaviour, as in <a class="popup" href="#">Stephanie Syjuco’s <span><img src="images/stephanie.png" height="400px" width="450px"></span></a> books — or ‘non-specific product units’ — which seem to evangelically revolve around the ‘freeness’ of text:</p>

<p>Often, the poetics of both the material and the sourcing techniques are brought out in their transition — or traversal — to print, while specific narratives are suppressed. The database and the network might have a centre, but not a start or an end. It’ll tell you a different story depending on the question that it’s asked.</p>

 <h1>The Cobweb:
 Can the Internet be archived?</h1>
</div>

<br> <br>

<p>
Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 took off from Amsterdam at 10:31 a.m. G.M.T. on July 17, 2014, for a twelve-hour flight to Kuala Lumpur. Not much more than three hours later, the plane, a Boeing 777, crashed in a field outside Donetsk, Ukraine. All two hundred and ninety-eight people on board were killed. The plane’s last radio contact was at 1:20 p.m. G.M.T. At 2:50 p.m. G.M.T., Igor Girkin, a Ukrainian separatist leader also known as Strelkov, or someone acting on his behalf, posted a message on VKontakte, a Russian social-media site: “We just downed a plane, an AN-26.” (An Antonov 26 is a Soviet-built military cargo plane.) The post includes links to video of the wreckage of a plane; it appears to be a Boeing 777.
</p>

<p>On July 17th, at 3:22 p.m. G.M.T., the Wayback Machine saved a screenshot of Strelkov’s VKontakte post about downing a plane. Two hours and twenty-two minutes later, Arthur Bright, the Europe editor of the Christian Science Monitor, tweeted a picture of the screenshot, along with the message “Grab of Donetsk militant Strelkov’s claim of downing what appears to have been MH17.” By then, Strelkov’s VKontakte page had already been edited: the claim about shooting down a plane was deleted. The only real evidence of the original claim lies in the Wayback Machine.</p>

<br>

<p> The average life of a Web page is about a hundred days. Strelkov’s “We just downed a plane” post lasted barely two hours. It might seem, and it often feels, as though stuff on the Web lasts forever, for better and frequently for worse: the embarrassing photograph, the regretted blog (more usually regrettable not in the way the slaughter of civilians is regrettable but in the way that bad hair is regrettable). No one believes any longer, if anyone ever did, that “if it’s on the Web it must be true,” but a lot of people do believe that if it’s on the Web it will stay on the Web. Chances are, though, that it actually won’t. In 2006, David Cameron gave a speech in which he said that Google was democratizing the world, because “making more information available to more people” was providing “the power for anyone to hold to account those who in the past might have had a monopoly of power.” Seven years later, Britain’s Conservative Party scrubbed from its Web site ten years’ worth of Tory speeches, including that one. Last year, BuzzFeed deleted more than four thousand of its staff writers’ early posts, apparently because, as time passed, they looked stupider and stupider. Social media, public records, junk: in the end, everything goes. </p>
